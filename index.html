            <h3>General Rules</h3>
			<p>No over-using racism.</p>
			<p>Do not impersonate other players (particularly an admin).</p>
			<p>No hacks and/or Bhop scripts. The use of any will warrant a permanent ban.</p>
			<p>No mic/chat spamming or excessive yelling unless an admin says it's all right based on a popular vote.</p>
			<p>Listen to admins; They have Final say.</p>
			<p>No advertising.</p>
			 
			<h3>Zombie Mod Rules</h3>
			Do not destroy barricades intentionally.
			Do not abuse !block (e.g using it to get people stuck inside or outside of a certain place).
			Do not Edge (e.g standing on the Edge of a spot close to the humans in order to get infected then infect them).
			Do not Disconnect/Suicide/Switch teams when you're the only Zombie left.
			 
			Admins
			Please use discretion and allow time for new players to learn the rules.
			Punishments can include warnings, slay, kick, ban (not necessarily in that order).
			If you are punished by an admin, take a deep breath and try to understand what you did before you complain.
			To talk directly to admins, use team chat and type @ before your sentence (i.e. @what's up admins?).
			 
			Zombie Mod Information
			We are currently debugging the frequent server crashes. Please report any suspicious activity when the server crashes.
			The European Zombie Mod server has poor server performance. This is due to a Linux limitation in CS:GO where the server cannot use over 100% CPU instead of 150% CPU (Windows). We are communicating with Valve about this issue and hope to get it fixed soon.

			FAQ
			1. What makes GFL's Zombie Mod server stand out from others?
			A: A number of things makes us stand out. We have good/fair admins. This server is on a machine with a Xeon 1271 @ 3.6 GHz processor. Therefore, the server should withstand 64 players at fairly good server FPS.
			 
			2. Are there any items in the store?
			A: Yes, tracers, glow colors, and more!
			 
			3 Are there any other GFL CS:GO servers?
			A: Yes, we have many other servers in CS:GO. This includes: Surf RPG Deathmatch, Surf Timer, Zombie Escape, etc..
			 
			4 What is the objective of Zombie Mod?
			A: The objective of Zombie Mod is to survive until the round time ends. I would suggest barricading yourself somewhere and try to wait it out by shooting the zombies.
			 
			 
			Links
			None.
			Thanks.
